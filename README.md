# happy-birthday

A small page build for my Father's Birthday, displaying an animated age counter in binary format rapidly incrementing until reaching a set value.  

## Set-up 

To change the displayed message and the target age for the binary counter, open `main.js` and change the `AGE` and `birthdayText` variables accordingly.
